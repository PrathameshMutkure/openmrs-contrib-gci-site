# Contributing to OpenMRS Google Code-in Website

üëã‚ú® First off, thanks for showing interest in the project and welcome to the OpenMRS community! ‚ú®üëã

The following are guidelines for contributing to this repository. Note that these are guidelines and it's best to use one's own judgement in makign decisions. Feel free to propose changes to this guide.

## What is the OpenMRS Google Code-in (GCI) Website Project?

The OpenMRS GCI Website Project is designed to inform Google Code-in Students working with OpenMRS of the administration of the Google Code-in program as well as how to contribute to the OpenMRS community. The project was undertaken to replace the current [Wiki page](https://om.rs/gci) describing the OpenMRS Google Code-in program, finding it to be tedious in writing and cluttered. The goals of this project are to provide all the necessary information to students regarding the contribution rules for OpenMRS and allow students to properly submit tasks, reducing errors and time in review. 

## Stages of the Project

  * Planning üìù **Status :** ‚úÖ
      * Involves defining requirements for the website including which pages should be present, necessary content to present, website structure, and project organization. This stage was completed through the work of students and mentors during Google Code-in 2018.
  * Design üñº **Status :** üõ†
      * Designs from task submissions from Google Code-in 2018 are gathered and the community is surveyed for their opinion on a central design theme for the page. Critical decisions involving design are made at this stage as assets and other details (color palette, padding sizes, images, backgrounds, etc.) are perfected to ensure a smooth designing experience. Upon the completion of the surveying and refining processes, the community designs the full web page taking into account suggestions provided for the proposed theme in a mobile and computer friendly manner.
   * Coding üíª **Status :** ‚õî
       * Coding will be done in React to implement all of the pages according to the designs specified and following the coding style set by the project. This stage involves testing of the project.

## How to contribute to this project?

### Submitting Feature/Bug Requests for Any Additions or Edits to the Project
There's many beginner-friendly aspects in each of the three stages of the project you may contribute to, and we're always looking for helping hands! The first step in contributing is ensuring to submit a [new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ykarim/openmrs-contrib-gci-site/issues/new) detailing the feature you would like to add to the project or edit. This is required regardless of if the addition/edit to be made involves the design, code, or any other aspect of the project. This is done to organize all additions/edits to the project. Before submitting a new issue, please check all other issues to ensure that your issue isn't repititive. After submitting, wait for maintainer feedback for further steps.

### Working on an Issue

#### Claiming Issues

Contributors must claim issues before working on them to avoid the conflict of two contributors working on the same feature. To claim an issue, comment that you will be working on this issue and the maintainers will update the label to "In Progress" as they see fit. Before starting on an issue, ensure that it is valid and has the "Ready for Work" badge as this badge signals if an issue is valid and in need of work. Also, avoid claiming multiple issues at once as this will prevent others from contributing to the project.

#### Finding Issues

To find issues to work on for the "Ready for Work" badge as this badge signals issues that are unclaimed and ready for work. For beginner-friendly issues, look for the "Good First Issue" badge.

### Submitting a Pull Request for an Issue

Submitting a pull request can be done after a contrubitor has committed their change to their fork of this repository. Commit titles, commit descriptions, pull request titles, and pull request descriptions must be descriptive for maintainers to understand what changes were made and for records keeping of the repository. The branch name for the pull request must bear resemblance to the issue. For example if an issue is to update the README, the pull request branch may be "README-update". For further information, check out [OpenMRS Pull Request Tips](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Pull+Request+Tips).

## How to report new features/bugs?

Reporting changes to the project is easily done through the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ykarim/openmrs-contrib-gci-site/issues) page for this project.
